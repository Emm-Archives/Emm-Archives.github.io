: This game is going to mess with your brain, I'm telling you. This literally hurts my brain because of what you can do with it. You can play it with one computer via remote play or if you're together. It's fun, plus it has free additional content.

: If you haven't noticed it, I really like playing puzzle games or anything that requires thinking because, why not??? So this game is like we were here, but in 2D. And also, be clear in your communication; it can help.

### Project Playtime
![Project Playtime](https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1961460/header.jpg?t=1698444117){: width="972" height="589" }
_<https://store.steampowered.com/app/1961460/PROJECT_PLAYTIME/>_
- Genre: Horror, Puzzle
- Review:
: So in this game, you need to have as many people as possible. because we played this as a coop and every single time the other one becomes the monster, so thats a bummer but still a fun game to mess with your friends, and the mini games to get the prize are fun and nerve-wracking, never knowing if someone is behind you...Â     
### Gravewood High
![Gravewood High](https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1239300/header.jpg?t=1722951375){: width="972" height="589" }
_<https://store.steampowered.com/app/1239300/Gravewood_High/>_
- Genre: Horror, Puzzle
- Review:
: It's the same as project playtime, but you can play with an AI enemy. My friends and I were serious at first, but when it came to the last key, we were trolling hard, and we always got killed or fell in some places.

## HONORABLE MENTIONS
Good Games that we haven't yet tried but is still on our playlist.

### Come with Me

- What I know:
: It's a split-screen game. This can be played via remote play, or if you want to have your own world, then do your thing separately.

### Trash Patrol - Academic Version
![Trash Patrol - Academic Version](https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1969130/header.jpg?t=1652992256){: width="972" height="589" }

- What I know:
: Up to 4 players only, this is like moving out, but the twist is that you and your friends are going to steal what you can. Clean up the items you steal to get them because thats what racoons do.

### Bronzebeard's Tavern
![Bronzebeard's Tavern](https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2422870/header.jpg?t=1720953647){: width="972" height="589" }
_<https://store.steampowered.com/app/2422870/Bronzebeards_Tavern/>_
- Genre: Multiplayer
- What I know:
: If you know Overcooked or Plateup, then this can be for you and your friends. You and your friends can get different roles to run your tavern. So gear up and brew your mead done!

### PICO PARK: Classic Edition
![PICO PARK: Classic Edition](https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/461040/header.jpg?t=1704797196){: width="972" height="589" }
_<https://store.steampowered.com/app/461040/PICO_PARKClassic_Edition/>_
- Genre: Multiplayer
- What I know:
: If you're broke, just like me, you and your friends don't have to pay to play PICO PARK because there's a free version of it, just so you can try it out! Good luck trolling and making your friends mad!

### Blind Trust
![Blind Trust](https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/468560/header.jpg?t=1464360517){: width="972" height="589" }
_<https://store.steampowered.com/app/468560/Blind_Trust/>_
- Genre: Adventure, Co-op
- What I know:
: I've been wanting to play this for the longest time, but my girlfriend and I haven't had the time to play it because we were both busy doing our stuff. This game challenges you to communicate clearly while having the patience to not troll and so on. This game is about blind and deaf people working together to kill enemies and solve puzzles.
